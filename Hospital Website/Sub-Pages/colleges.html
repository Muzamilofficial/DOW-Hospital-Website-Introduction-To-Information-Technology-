The college was subsequently named after him.

After creation of Pakistan, the College was affiliated to Sindh University at Karachi in December, 1947. Subsequently in 1951, when Sindh University was shifted to Hyderabad and Karachi University came into existence, the College was affiliated with Karachi University.
