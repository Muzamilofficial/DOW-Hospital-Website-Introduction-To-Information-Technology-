			<header class="over-view">Overview</header>
			<p class="view">When people think of the deadliest diseases in the world, their minds probably jump to the fast-acting, incurable ones that grab headlines from time to time. But in fact, many of these types of diseases don’t rank in the top 10 causes of worldwide deaths. An estimated 56.4 million peopleTrusted Source passed away worldwide in 2015, and 68 percent of them were due to diseases that progressed slowly.
				<br>
				<br>
Perhaps even more surprising is that several of the deadliest diseases are partially preventable. Non-preventable factors include where a person lives, access to preventive care, and quality of healthcare. These all factor into risk. But there are still steps everyone can take to lower their risk.
<br>
<br>
Read on to see the top 10 diseases causing the most deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)Trusted Source.</p>
<div class="disease1">
	<header class="name">1. Ischemic heart disease, or coronary artery disease</header>
	<img src="..\Images\disease1.png" class="img-disease" height="400" width="100%">
	<p class="dp">The deadliest disease in the world is coronary artery disease (CAD). Also called ischemic heart disease, CAD occurs when the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart become narrowed. Untreated CAD can lead to chest pain, heart failure, and arrhythmias.</p>
	<header class="sub-heading">Impact of CAD across the world:</header>
	<blockquote>Although it’s still the leading cause of death, mortality rates have declined in many European countries and in the United States. This may be due to better public health education, access to healthcare, and forms of prevention. However, in many developing nations, mortality rates of CAD are on the rise. An increasing life span, socioeconomic changes, and lifestyle risk factors play a role in this rise.</blockquote>

	<header class="sub-heading">Impact of stroke across the world:</header>
	<blockquote>In fact, strokes are the leading causeTrusted Source of long-term disabilities. People who receive treatment within 3 hours of having a stroke are less likely to have disabilities.

	<header class="name">10. Cirrhosis</header>
	<img src="..\Images\disease10.png" class="img-disease" height="400" width="100%">
	<p class="dp">Cirrhosis is the result of chronic or long-term scarring and damage to the liver. The damage may be the result of a kidney disease, or it can be caused by conditions like hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. A healthy liver filters harmful substances from your blood and sends healthy blood into your body. As substances damage the liver, scar tissue forms. As more scar tissue forms, the liver has to work harder to function properly. Ultimately, the liver may stop working.</p>
	<header class="sub-heading">Risk factors and prevention</header>
	<blockquote class="disease-block">Risk factors for Cirrhosis include:

		<br>
        Stay away from the behaviors that can lead to liver damage to help prevent cirrhosis. Long-term alcohol use and abuse is one of the leading causes of cirrhosis, so avoiding alcohol can help you prevent damage. Likewise, you can avoid nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by eating a diet that’s healthy, rich in fruits and vegetables, and low in sugar and fat. Lastly, you can reduce the likelihood of contracting viral hepatitis by using protection during sex and by avoiding sharing anything that could have traces of blood. This includes needles, razors, toothbrushes, and more.
    </blockquote>
    <header class="name">The Takeaway</header>
    <blockquote class="takeaway">While deaths from some diseases have increased, those from more serious conditions have also decreased. Some factors, such as an increasing life span, naturally increase the incidence of diseases such as CAD, stroke, and heart disease. But many of the diseases on this list are preventable and treatable. As medicine continues to advance and prevention education grows, we may see a reduction in death rates from these diseases.
    	<br>
    	<br>
    	A good approach to lowering your risk of any of these conditions is to live a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition and exercise. Avoiding smoking and drinking in moderation can also help. For bacterial or viral infections, proper handwashing can help prevent or reduce your risk.
